# Angular Basics

## What is Angular?

 - Angular is a JavaScript framework for building web applications.
 - It's maintained by Google and has a large community of developers contributing to it.
 - Angular is built on TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript that adds features like static typing, interfaces, and classes.

## Getting Started with Angular

 - To get started with Angular, you'll need to install Node.js and the Angular CLI (Command Line Interface).
 - You can create a new Angular project using the ng new command, followed by the name of your project.
 - Once your project is created, you can run it using the ng serve command. This will start a local development server that you can access in your browser at http://localhost:4200.

## Components

 - In Angular, components are the building blocks of your application.
 - A component is a TypeScript class with a decorator that specifies its metadata, such as its template and styles.
 - You can create a new component using the ng generate component command, followed by the name of your component.

## Templates

 - Templates are the HTML markup that defines the view for your component.
 - In Angular, you use a special syntax called "interpolation" to bind data from your component to your template.
 - You can also use directives like *ngIf and *ngFor to conditionally render elements in your template.

## Services

 - Services are used to provide functionality that can be shared across multiple components.
 - A service is a TypeScript class with a decorator that specifies its metadata, such as its provider.
 - You can create a new service using the ng generate service command, followed by the name of your service.

## Dependency Injection
 - In Angular, you use dependency injection to provide instances of services to your components.
 - Dependency injection is a design pattern that allows you to write more modular and testable code.
 - You can use the constructor of your component to specify the dependencies that it needs.
